Welcome, this is the second Stock of the Week post, for the week of November 10, 2024. In my Stock of the Week posts, I discuss a security (stock or ETF) that I am currently buying or selling, and will explain my rationale. These are trades I am personally making, so you will either make money with me or lose money with me by entering these trades (ideally the former).

## Stock of the Week
The Stock of the Week this week is [**RDTE**](https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/rdte/), which represents the *Small Cap 0DTE Covered Call Strategy ETF* by Roundhill Investments. With the election win of Donald Trump, Small Cap stocks are in a prime position for growth, thanks to lower taxes and a looser governmental regulatory environment. Rather than trying to pick and choose the specific stock/s I think will benefit the most, I would rather invest in an ETF that provides exposure to the Small Cap Index of the Russell 2000. $RDTE sells out-of-the-money 0DTE (0 days till expiration) calls to provide weekly dividend income, as well as exposure to the price return of the Russell 2000. $RDTE has a %31.61 Dividend Yield ([Roundhill Investments](https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/rdte/)), and is currently up %9.5 YTD since inception on September 10, 2024. I will be buying $RDTE and slowly increasing my position over time on down days.  

Today would also be a good day to take advantage of the dip and buy [**$TSLY**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf/tsly/dividend-history) - *YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF* - if you have the funds to spare. The $TSLY ETF has a Dividend Yield of %74.26 according to [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf/tsly/dividend-history). I currently have a substantial position of $3000 in this ETF and will not be buying more today.
