The Preface (Genesis 1-11) is a chiasm!

Middle: Genesis 5:28-29 - "When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son. He named him **Noah** and said, 'He will **comfort** us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.'"

Noah = "comfort"

The story is good, trust the story...
