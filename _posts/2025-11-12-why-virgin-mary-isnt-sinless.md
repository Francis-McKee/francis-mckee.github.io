Is the Virgin Mary without sin and free from the curse of the original sin of Adam and Eve in the garden?

Based on my research and conversations with friends and family who are Catholic, the verses in the Bible commonly used to support the claim that the Virgin Mary was free from sin are Luke 1:26-38. These verses describe the conversation between the angel Gabriel and Mary.

## The Conversation
> Luke 1:26-38 - "And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, 'Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.' And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, 'Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.' Then said Mary unto the angel, 'How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?' And the angel answered and said unto her, 'The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible.' And Mary said, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.' And the angel departed from her."

Let's break this passage down to the specific words the angel Gabriel says to Mary that may support the claim of the Catholic that she was free from sin.

> Luke 1:28 - "Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women."

## Arguement Against
Below is the same verse with a few words bolded that I would like to focus on.

> Luke 1:28 - "Hail, thou that art **highly favoured**, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou **among** women."

The meaning for the phrase ‘highly favored’ is the Greek word *charitóō* meaning graciously accepted or much graced. And those who need to be much graced are those who have sinned much, which we all have. It really means to give grace to as Mary was to bear Jesus Christ, the whole measure of God’s grace, in her womb. The word for ‘highly favored’ is used in one other place in Ephesians 1:6 with the word ‘accepted’, as referring to all believers being accepted because of His grace. 

Notice also the use of the word 'among' in English. Mary is not blessed 'above' women, rather she is on the same playing field.

Later in the same chapter we come to this verse, which is part of a quote from Mary:

> Luke 1:48 - " For he hath regarded the **low estate** of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed."

The Greek for ‘low estate’ is *tapeínosis* which means the act of humiliation. In this verse the Virgin Mary is stated as possessed of *tapeínōsin*, the recognition of her sinfulness and therefore humility.

## Only God is Without Sin
Let's look at a few verses that show that only the Lord God is without sin:

> Revelation 15:4 - “Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For **thou only art holy**"

> Romans 3:23 - “For **all have sinned and fall short** of the glory of God”

> Ecclesiastes 7:20 - “Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.”

> Romans 3:10 - “As it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one;”

## Conclusion
From an initial reading of the chapter of Luke, I could see how some would believe that mary was free from sin and the curse of the original sin, even if I disagree. However, upon closer examination we can see that no one other than the Lord God is holy, free from sin, and worthy of glory.
