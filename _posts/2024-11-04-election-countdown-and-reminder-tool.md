# Announcing my new Election Countdown and Reminder Tool
With election season *right* around the corner, I'm excited to share a new tool I developed to help everyone stay prepared and informed. Whether you're already registered or still figuring out voting details, my **Election Countdown and Reminder Tool** has you covered!  

## About the Tool:
The Election Countdown & Reminder Tool is designed to simplify the voting process. Here's how it can help:
* **Countdown Timer:** A live countdown to Election Day, so you know exactly how much time remains.
* **Calendar Reminders:** Choose your reminder timing (one week, one day, or on Election Day) and add it directly to your Google calendar.
* **Voter Resources:** Quick links to check your registration status, find your polling location, request an absentee ballor, and view early voting dates.
* **AI Political Survey:** Curious where your views align? Take my quick survey to see which party matches your opinions. *Your responses are anonymous and not saved.*

## Discussion:
I wanted to create a tool for this 2024 election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. I originally started developing this tool in October before the election but stopped development because I didn't think it was worthy of being a **"portfolio project"** (insert jazz hands). Anyways, eventually I continued working on it and decided to post it now in November, one day before the election... not very helpful, I know. When I focus on perfection and everything looking "right" I tend to end up not creating anything. As an unfortunate example, this blog was created in 2023, and my first post is now in November 2024. Hopefully people can find some solace in my struggles, as I am sure I am not the only creative struggling with this. Luckily this project can easily be reused, having now been developed (and posted!) with enough time in advance for people to actually use it to countdown to future elections.
