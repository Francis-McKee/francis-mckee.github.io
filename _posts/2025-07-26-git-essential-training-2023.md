Just finished the course “Git Essential Training (2023)” by Barbara Forbes on LinkedIn Learning! 

Although I had a solid foundation in Git, this course introduced a few unfamiliar commands and techniques that will help streamline my workflow and boost both productivity and version control practices. Looking forward to applying these insights across personal projects and professional work.

## Git Commands
Here is a list of Git commands taught in this course:
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone`: Clone a remote repository to your local machine.
- `git add`: Stage changes for the next commit.
- `git commit`: Commit staged changes to the repository.
- `git push`: Push committed changes to a remote repository.
- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory and staging area.
- `git log`: View the commit history.
- `git branch`: Manage branches in your repository.
- `git checkout`: Switch between branches.
- `git merge`: Merge changes from one branch into another.
- `git revert`: Revert to a previous commit.
