This is the fourth Stock of the Week post, for the week of December 1, 2024. In my Stock of the Week posts, I discuss a security (stock or ETF) that I am currently buying or selling, and will explain my rationale. These are trades I am personally making, so you will either make money with me or lose money with me by entering these trades (ideally the former).

## Stock of the Week
This week's Stock of the Week is [**$MRNY**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf/mrny), the *YieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF*. Moderna ($MRNA) is currently down 62.5% at the time of writing, which we can take advantage of by buying [**$MRNY**]. Due to the recent presidential election win of Donald Trump, I believe legislation will be put in place (such as banning direct-to-consumer advertisements for pharma companies) that will continue to drive down the profits of MRNA, driving down the share price as well for MRNA and MRNY. This makes $MRNY even better for cash flow, as if we reinvest our dividends we will be able to buy more shares at the cheaper prices (as long as the ETF is not reverse split back to $30+). I recommend turning Dividend Reinvestment on for MRNY until *YieldMax* decides to do a reverse split to maximize your cash flow while share price is cheap. Once the ETF is reverse split we can then analyze our position and decide whether to turn Dividend Reinvestment off and use the dividends elsewhere.  

As previously mentioned, my goal for my portfolio is to generate weekly cash flow through dividend income, and I believe MRNY is a perfect addition to our portfolio to help us with that. MRNY is currently at $5.46 per share, down 1.27% on the day. According to [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf/mrny/dividend-history), MRNY has an 87.06% Dividend Yield, paying monthly distributions of about $0.40 per share. I currently have a substantial position in MRNY of 790 shares (about $4,000), which multiplied by about $0.40 per share should earn me about $316.00 in dividends per month! The ex-date for MRNY for the month of December is today, December 4, with Payment date being tomorrow, December 5. I view MRNY as a long term hold in my portfolio as long as the dividends continue being paid out.
