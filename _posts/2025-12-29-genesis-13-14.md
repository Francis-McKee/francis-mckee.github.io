Genesis 13-14 - Abram and Lot

## Abram and Lot Separate
Genesis 13

Problems:
* weird phrase about the Canaanites and the Perizzites (7b), also appears in 12:6
* Abram calls Lot his brother (8)

This story is linked to the previous story in Genesis 12b. Has Abram learned anything?

Abram let go of his plan for how God's promise would be fulfilled, as he lets Lot go. Also, Abram is the patriarch but he lets Lot pick the land he wanted to settle in first. He does not even look up until God tells him to (14).

After he showed God his character by letting Lot have the first pick, God made a promise revealing His blessing for Abram.

## Abram Rescues Lot
Genesis 14

Lot pitches his tent near Sodom (13:2), and later the kings in that area go to war, and Lot is captured.

Abram went to rescue Lot, and after defeating the kings, he gives all the goods and people back, including Lot! We see Lot next in Genesis 19.

Abram made a mistake in Egypt, learns a lesson, but does not let the mistake define him, as he again shows his character and trusts the story.
