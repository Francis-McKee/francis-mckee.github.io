Welcome, this is the first of many Stock of the Week posts. In such posts, I will discuss a security (stock or ETF) that I am currently buying or selling, and will explain my rational. These are trades I am personally making, so you will either make money with me or lose money with me by entering these trades (ideally the former).

## Stock of the Week
The first Stock of the Week is an ETF with the ticker symbol [**$FIAT**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf/fiat). The ETF ticker symbol **$FIAT** represents the *YieldMax Short COIN Option Income Strategy ETF*. This ETF is unique in that it provides exposure to inverse movements of Coinbase (COIN) stock. Its strategy uses a synthetic covered put approach, which essentially generates income from options and provides limited downside exposure if the stock decreases in value. As of November 6, 2024 at 2:12 pm EST, the ETF is down over %28. This is due to the euphoria of Donald Trump's 2024 election win, driving up the share price of $COIN over %30 at the time of writing.  

I will be buying 250 shares of **$FIAT** today for a total cost basis of a little under $3000. As the euphoria of the elction comes down, I predict the price of bitcoin will fall in the short term, bringing down the price of $COIN back to normal numbers. This will drive the price of **$FIAT** up and we should be able to collect some nice capital gains. **$FIAT** has a current dividend yield of 107.17% according to [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/etf/fiat/dividend-history), and pays monthly. The previous monthly payment was $1.4513 per share. The Ex-Dividend date this month is Thursday November 14, with Payment date being the next day, Friday November 15. By buying today at a low, we can expect both capital gains in the short term and a dividend later this month. We can then decide after the dividend Payment date to continue to hold $FIAT for passive dividend income or sell to realize our capital gains.
