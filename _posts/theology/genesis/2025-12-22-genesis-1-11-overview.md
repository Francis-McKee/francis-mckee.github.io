Genesis 1-11 (Overview) - The Preface

<br>

Scripture:
* Genesis 1-11 = Preface
* Genesis 12-50 = Introduction
* Exodus - Revelation = Narrative

Preface - Genesis 1-11  
* Creation - Genesis 1
* Adam and Eve - Genesis 2-3
* Cain and Abel - Genesis 4
* Geneology - Genesis 5
* The Flood - Genesis 6-9a
* Noah's Curse - Genesis 9b-10
* Tower of Babel - Genesis 11a
* Geneology - Genesis 11b

It might be easier to see this way...
* A: Creation - *ruach*, be fruitful and multiply, Sabbath rest
* B: Adam and Eve - garden, fruit, nakedness, covering the nakedness, curse
* C: Cain and Abel - sacrifices/offerings to Heaven, Cain cursed to wander, acquiring flocks and crops
* D: Geneology
* A': The Flood - *ruach*, be fruitful and multiply, Sabbath rest
* B': Noah's Curse - vineyard, fruit, nakedness, covering the nakedness, curse
* C': Tower of Babel - tower to Heaven, the people are scattered, acquiring brick and slime
* D': Geneology

The Preface (Genesis 1-11) is a chiasm!

Middle:
> Genesis 5:28-29 - "When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son. He named him **Noah** and said, 'He will **comfort** us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.'"

Noah = "comfort"

The story is good, trust the story...
