Genesis 27 - The (Stolen) Blessing

<br>

Did Rebekah not tell her husband Isaac what the Lord had said to her in Genesis 25:23?

Isaac's Blessing:
> Genesis 27:28-29 - "Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: **be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee**: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee."

Isaac intended to give this blessing to Esau, meaning that part of his blessing was that Jacob would bow down in service to Esau, which is contrary to the Lord's promise in Genesis 25:23.

> Genesis 25:23 - "And the Lord said unto her, 'Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; **and the elder shall serve the younger.**"

> Genesis 25:28 - "And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob." 

Would Isaac have loved Jacob more if he was aware of the Lord's promise?

Regardless, we can see that the Lord played a key role in this story. His promise to Rebekah in Genesis 25:23 shows that this was His plan right from the start.

Jacob = "the heel-grabber, i.e the supplanter"

> Genesis 27:35-36 - "And he [Esau] said, Thy brother came with subtlety, and hath taken away thy blessing. And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing." ...
