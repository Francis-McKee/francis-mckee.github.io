Genesis 20 - Abraham and Abimelech

<br>

Abraham again says that Sarah, his wife, is his sister. (2) (also Genesis 12:10-20)

God (Elohim) came to Abimelech in a dream by night and says that he has taken another man’s wife. Abimelech pleads his integrity and his innocence in that he was deceived. 

God calls Abraham a prophet (*navi*), meaning “a speaker of oracles, one who was actuated by a divine Spirit; an authorized spokesman (usually for God). Such an individual did not speak his own words, but those which he had received from God.” (2 Peter 1:20-21)

Abimelech rose early in the morning and 
Abimelech takes sheep, oxen, menservants, and women-servants, and a thousand pieces of silver, and gives them to Abraham.

We find out at the end of the story that the Lord had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, so Abraham prayed unto God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his maidservants, and they bare children.
