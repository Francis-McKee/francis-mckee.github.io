Genesis 43 - The Brothers Return to Egypt

<br>

Jacob again asks his sons to go down to Egypt to get more food (2).

> Genesis 43:8-9 - "And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then **let me bear the blame for ever**:"

In this chapter we read that Judah asks Jacob if he could take Benjamin to Egypt, and offers himself up as collateral if anything happens to Benjamin. This is major chutzpah on his part (read verse 10), and a point of growth in taking personal responsibility.

This move by Judah changes the mind of Jacob, and he allows them to take Benjamin down to Egypt. Reuben's offer of his two sons as collateral did not get Jacob's attention in [Genesis 42](https://fnmckee.com/theology/2026/02/13/genesis-42.html), but Judah's offer of himself did.
