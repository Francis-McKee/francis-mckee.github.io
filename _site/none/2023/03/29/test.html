<p>This is a test for my first blog post.</p>

<p>I intend to use this blog as more of a DevLog to detail what I am currently working on, and to talk about my experiences and issues. Most categories of this blog relate to a specific project of the same name, but posts that are not project specific will be included under the category “none”, such as this post here.</p>
