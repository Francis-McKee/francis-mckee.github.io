<h1> Categories: </h1>

            <h2><a href="/categories/programming.html">Programming</a></h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <p><p>This is a category created for posts relating to programming, including courses I have completed and projects I am working on. The courses could be part of my formal education, or courses that I have completed for my own learning.</p>
</p>

            <h2><a href="/categories/random.html">Random</a></h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <p><p>This is a category for random posts that do not necessarily fit in another category.</p>
</p>

        <li>
            <h2><a href="/categories/theology.html">Theology</a></h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <p><p>This category exists as a place for my theology notes from private study, listening to podcasts, and attending church on Sunday. One problem I have always had is that my handwritten notes end up scattered and out of order based on which portion of Scripture I happen to be studying at the time. This category solves that problem by allowing me to organize my notes in biblical order, from Genesis to Revelation, while still giving me the flexibility to revisit older notes, revise them, or add new insights as I continue learning.</p>

<p>Another practical issue is that notebooks fill up quickly and are not easy to carry everywhere. By using this website, I can keep my notes in one place on a single device that fits in my pocket. This allows me, when I am away from home and talking with others, to quickly reference both Scripture and my notes with confidence.</p>

<h2 id="attribution">Attribution</h2>

<p>I do not attempt to profit from these notes (there are no advertisements), and I will link to my sources whenever possible at the bottom of each post. I do not earn income from Amazon affiliate links or any similar program in these posts. Please <a href="https://fnmckee.com/contact.html">contact me</a> if there is anything I can do to better credit my sources. I take this very seriously and have no desire to take credit for the work of others as if it were my own.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>These posts are notes, not summaries or polished essays. Because of this, they may not always follow a clean or logical structure and may not always make immediate sense to the reader. Hebrew words are written in <em>italics</em>, and words or phrases of particular importance are emphasized using <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>

<p>I do my best to indicate which verse is being referenced, either by using just the verse number (for example, (9)) or by using the chapter and verse (for example, (11:9)) when multiple chapters are involved. I will also often include full Scripture quotations in the notes, which are clearly marked using the full book name, chapter, and verse, such as:</p>

<p>John 3:16 — “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”</p>

<h3 id="problems-in-the-notes">“Problems” in the Notes</h3>

<p>In some posts I use the heading “Problems.” This is not meant to imply that the biblical text is flawed or in error. Rather, it is a shorthand label for observations that stand out as difficult, surprising, unclear, or in need of further thought.</p>

<p>These may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tensions between passages</li>
  <li>Unusual wording or structure</li>
  <li>Questions raised by the text itself</li>
  <li>Details that do not immediately make sense on a first reading</li>
</ul>

<p>Identifying these “problems” is part of careful reading. They are starting points for study, not conclusions, and in many cases they remain open questions rather than resolved issues.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-read-these-notes">How to Read These Notes</h2>

<p>These notes are primarily written for my own study and reflection. They are not intended to be authoritative teaching, final conclusions, or comprehensive explanations of a passage. Some posts may raise questions without immediately resolving them, while others may reflect my understanding at a particular point in time rather than a settled position.</p>

<p>As I continue studying, older posts may be revised, expanded, or clarified. Disagreement is expected, and readers are encouraged to examine the Scriptures for themselves and test what is written here rather than accepting it uncritically.</p>

<h2 id="scripture-and-authority">Scripture and Authority</h2>

<p>Scripture is treated as the primary and authoritative source for theology in these notes. Literary structure, historical context, and comparisons to other ancient writings are used as tools to aid understanding, not as authorities that override or correct the biblical text.</p>
