  <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Francis McKee, and I am a student at who is studying at Pitt Community College in Winterville, NC. After recieving an Associates in Science, I chose to further my education with the certificate "Simulation and Game Design: Programming". I chose to study to become a Game Developer and take the Programming certificate because I am specifically interested in the programming side of Game Design. I also plan to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>While I most enjoy creating websites and developing games, I also enjoy other programming projects! I have programming experience with the markup language HTML, styling language CSS, as well as with multiple programming languages including JavaScript, Jekyll, C#, TI-Basic (used in Texas Instruments calculators) and the game engine Unity. 
    </p>
