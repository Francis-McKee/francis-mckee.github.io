# Francis-McKee.github.io

## Description
This is the official website of Francis McKee (me). This website was coded 100% by me in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and YAML. This website also has a blog which was made with Jekyll, which uses Markdown, Liquid, HTML, and CSS! The majority of this website was developed in 2022-2023, but is constantly being updated and revised as I learn more and create new projects. This website includes a comprehensive list of all my games, microgames (games made by following tutorials, some as assignments for school), tools, art, and other projects.
