Official Website of FrankzeeTank

## Description
This is the official website of FrankzeeTank (me). This website was coded 100% by me (besides the occasional embeds from other sites) in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The majority of this website was developed in 2022.

### Pages
This website includes a comprehensive list of all my games, microgames (games made by following tutorials, some as assignments for school), tools, art, and other projects. I also added a page with all of my socials, including my YouTube and Twitch channels.
