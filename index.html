        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Francis McKee, and I am a student at who is studying at Pitt Community College in Winterville, NC. After recieving an Associates in Science, I chose to further my education with two certificates: Simulation and Game Design - Programming and Simulation and Game Design - Art. I chose to study to become a Game Developer and take both the Programming and Art certificates rather than just one because I am interested in both the programming and art/ graphic design sides that Game Design has to offer. Also, I often play videogames myself, so Game Design is something I could see myself doing for long because of my interest in videogames, as well as my enjoyment when I play them. I also occasionally stream on Twitch and upload videos to YouTube, which has further invested me into the world of gaming, content creation and work with technology.
        </p>
        <p>While I most enjoy developing games, I also enjoy other programming projects! I have programming experience with multiple programming languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swift, C, Python, and TI-Basic (used in TI calculators).
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, thanks for reading a bit about me! I encourage you to explore my website, as I am sure there will be something here that is of interest to you! I have linked to games, microgames, art, and other projects I have either developed or helped develop (my role in the project development will be clearly listed under each project link).
