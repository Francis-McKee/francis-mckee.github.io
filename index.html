        Hi, my name is Francis McKee and I am a current sophomore studying Computer Science at Liberty University, as well as studying online for a programming certificate from Pitt Community College. I am looking for a position that will enable me to utilize my programming, marketing, and design skills as a web developer. In 2019, I developed a website for a local truck and auto repair business, and since then I have been learning and improving my skills through my collegiate studies and personal research. I have studied multiple programming languages that will allow me to utilize different techniques to fulfill possible needs of the client. I'd love the opportunity to put my education and experience to work for your company.
