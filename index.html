        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is FrankzeeTank, and I am a student who is studying to become a Game Developer. I chose to study to become a Game Developer because I am interested in both the programming and art/ graphic design sides that Game Design has to offer. Also, I often play videogames myself, so Game Design is something I could see myself doing for long because of my interest in videogames, as well as my enjoyment when I play them. I am also a Twitch Streamer and YouTuber, which has further invested me into the world of content creation and work with technology.
        </p>
        <p>While I most enjoy developing games, I also enjoy other programming projects! I have programming experience with multiple programming languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swift, C, Python, and TI-Basic (used in TI calculators).
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, thanks for reading a bit about me! I encourage you to explore my website, as I am sure there will be something here that is of interest to you! I have linked to games, microgames, art, and other projects I have either developed or helped develop (my role in the project development will be clearly listed under each project link).
        </p>
