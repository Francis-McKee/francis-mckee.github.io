        Hello everyone, my name is Francis McKee, and I am a sophomore studiying for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Liberty University. I am also studying online for a certificate in "Simulation and Game Design: Programming" from Pitt Community College in Winterville, NC.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I most enjoy creating websites and developing games, I also enjoy other programming projects, and have experience with the markup language HTML, styling language CSS, as well as with multiple programming languages including JavaScript, Jekyll (a Ruby gem), Python, C#, Swift, TI-Basic (used in Texas Instruments calculators) and the game engine Unity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also paid for and audited many programming courses on platforms such as Udemy, Coursera, and EDX - courses from industry leading companies such as Google and Meta, acclaimed universities such as Harvard and Duke University, as well as courses from other well known developers such as Chris DeLeon and the GameDev.tv Team.
