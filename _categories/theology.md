This category exists as a place for my theology notes from private study, listening to podcasts, and attending church on Sunday. One problem I have always had is that my handwritten notes end up scattered and out of order based on which portion of Scripture I happen to be studying at the time. This category solves that problem by allowing me to organize my notes in biblical order, from Genesis to Revelation, while still giving me the flexibility to revisit older notes, revise them, or add new insights as I continue learning.

Another practical issue is that notebooks fill up quickly and are not easy to carry everywhere. By using this website, I can keep my notes in one place on a single device that fits in my pocket. This allows me, when I am away from home and talking with others, to quickly reference both Scripture and my notes with confidence.
